error: zero-sized fields in `repr(transparent)` cannot contain external non-exhaustive types

  = warning: this was previously accepted by the compiler but is being phased out; it will become a hard error in a future release!
  = note: for more information, see issue #78586 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78586>
  = note: this struct contains `Id<'id>`, which contains private fields, and makes it not a breaking change to become non-zero-sized in the future.
note: the lint level is defined here
