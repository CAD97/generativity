  |     borrowed value does not live long enough

  | `branded_place` dropped here while still borrowed
  | borrow might be used here, when `lifetime_brand` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `LifetimeBrand`

  = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
  = note: this error originates in the macro `make_guard` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
